  Struggling with how to reason about the organization of the
  project. I find myself falling back into "The Kingdom of Nouns."
  For example, a Bot detects touchdowns and identifies Scorers given
  a TweetStream. I could define protocols for Bot, TweetStream, etc.,
  but I don't think that would be very Clojure-y, and I want to avoid
  writing Java with parenthesis.

  Found some inspriation from [[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded][My Clojure Worklflow, Reloaded]] on Stuart
  Sierra's blog. He talks about creating a 'system' map which
  contains all of the necessary components. Then each function takes
  a subset of this system map, according to which pieces of data it
  operates on.
  
  Thinking about it this way helps - My system is just a map comprised
  of a detector (function), a scorer identifier (function), a
  broadcast hook (functions), and a tweet stream (data). No objects
  necessary.
