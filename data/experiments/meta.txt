This file has tweets that are a response to a Cowboys touchdown but
mention the Falcons removed, just to see what the signal would look
like if we could automate this. I'm just making a judgement call on whether
I think the classifier could classify the tweet as not related to the
Falcons.

For example, this tweet stays:

{"text":"@Mule_Rock so far so good Cowboys moved from the 20 all the
way down to the Falcons touchdown in three plays yeah
baby","timestamp_ms":"1443373584145"}

Because it contains the text "Falcons touchdown" and I don't expect
any classifier I build to be that smart.
